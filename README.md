# ARDecor

ARDecor is an Augmented Reality (AR) Interior Design App that lets users visualize furniture in their homes before making a purchase. By leveraging AR technology, ARDecor reduces the risk of buying furniture that doesn't fit or match your space, offering a seamless and interactive way to design your home.

## Features
- **AR Visualization**: Place 3D furniture models in your real-world environment using your device's camera.
- **Real-Time Customization**: Adjust furniture colors, sizes, and styles to match your preferences.
- **Room Compatibility Check**: Measure and verify if furniture fits your space with AR-based spatial analysis.
- **Save & Share**: Capture your AR designs, save them, and share with friends or family for feedback.
- **Furniture Catalog**: Browse a wide range of furniture from partnered retailers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A smartphone or tablet with AR support (iOS: ARKit, Android: ARCore).
- Minimum OS: iOS 13.0 or Android 8.0.
- Internet connection for accessing the furniture catalog.

5. For mobile builds, use tools like React Native, Flutter, or Unity (depending on your stack).

## Usage
